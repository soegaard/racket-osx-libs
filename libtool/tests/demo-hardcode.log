demo-hardcode.test: ===  Finding libtool.m4's guesses at hardcoding values
= Searching for hardcoded library directories in each program
.libs was not hardcoded in `hc-direct', as libtool expected
`hc-libflag' was not linked properly, as libtool expected
`hc-libpath' was not linked properly, as libtool expected
.libs was not hardcoded in `hc-minusL', as libtool expected
